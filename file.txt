A JavaScript Framework is a very important part of modern web development.
There is no one framework for the codes, as every JavaScript framework serves a different purpose.
The frameworks are easy to apply as every application or website has some common features.
 It thus makes the task less laborious and time taking.
There are several popular JavaScript frameworks available 
including React.js, Angular, Vue.js, and Ember.js. 
Each framework has its own strengths, features, and community support.
